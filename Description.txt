🧬 NeuroLab AI — Local AI-Powered Lab Diagnostic Software
📌 Overview
NeuroLab AI is a self-contained, offline-capable, intelligent diagnostic software tailored for local laboratories. It empowers lab technicians and doctors by using locally installed AI models to analyze laboratory test results, medical scans (X-ray, MRI, CT), and generate accurate, printable PDF reports — all without the need for internet access.

🎯 Purpose
Bring AI diagnostics to under-resourced or internet-limited labs.

Allow instant test analysis and medical image interpretation using advanced models.

Provide paperless, secure, and digitally managed lab workflows.

Enable low-cost, scalable deployment for labs of all sizes.
